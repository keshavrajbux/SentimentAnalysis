Title: Sentiment Analysis

Description:

This project showcases my ability to perform comprehensive sentiment analysis on a dataset of text comments. It leverages the VADER SentimentIntensityAnalyzer to extract sentiment scores and generate insights, providing visualizations and exploratory techniques for deeper understanding.

Key Features:

Data loading and preprocessing:
Loads comment data from a CSV file.
Handles missing values and drops unnecessary columns.
Text cleaning:
Removes special characters, hashtags, and mentions, maintaining essential punctuation for nuanced analysis.
Converts text to lowercase for consistency.
Sentiment analysis:
Employs the VADER SentimentIntensityAnalyzer, generating compound, positive, and neutral scores.
Stores results in separate columns for further analysis.
Sentiment distribution:
Calculates and displays the overall distribution of positive, negative, and neutral sentiments, both quantitatively and visually.
Visualizations:
Creates bar, pie, histogram, box plot, scatter plot, and word cloud visualizations to provide diverse perspectives on sentiment patterns.
Exploratory analysis:
Enables comparisons of sentiment scores by categories (if present in the data).
Explores the relationship between compound and positive scores.
Generates word clouds for each sentiment category, revealing key terms associated with different sentiment types.
Technologies Used:

Python
pandas
NLTK (for data cleaning)
vaderSentiment
Next Steps:

Explore more advanced sentiment analysis techniques (e.g., machine learning models).
Integrate results with other data sources for richer insights.
Create interactive visualizations for deeper exploration.
